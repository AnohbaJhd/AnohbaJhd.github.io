[{"content":"Introduction In the evolving world of cloud-native applications, containerization has revolutionized how we build, ship, and run software. But as the number of containers in a project grows, managing them becomes a challenge. That’s where Container Orchestration steps in - and Kubernetes is the undisputed leader in this space.\nWhat is Container Orchestration? Container orchestration is a way to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of many containers.\nInstead of starting and stopping each container manually, orchestration tools (like Kubernetes) handle it for you - making sure your apps run smoothly, restart if they crash, and scale when needed.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s like having a smart system that keeps all your containerized apps organized and running the way you want, across multiple machines.\nWhat Is Kubernetes? Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source platform that automates deploying, scaling, and managing containerized applications.\nOriginally built by Google and now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), it enables:\nAutomatic container scheduling\nLoad balancing\nSelf-healing and auto-scaling\nService discovery\nWhy Minikube and kubectl? To run Kubernetes on your local machine, you need two key tools:\n1. kubectl - The Kubernetes Command-Line Tool kubectl is the primary way to interact with a Kubernetes cluster. You use it to:\nDeploy applications\nInspect and manage cluster resources\nView logs\nScale deployments\nExpose services\nWithout kubectl, you cannot communicate with your cluster’s API server or manage any workloads.\nThink of `kubectl` as your terminal interface to Kubernetes - just like git is to version control. 2. Minikube - Local Kubernetes Cluster Minikube is a lightweight tool that sets up a single-node Kubernetes cluster on your machine. It’s ideal for:\nLearning Kubernetes basics\nLocal development\nTesting configuration files before production\nPrerequisites Make sure you have:\nA system with virtualization enabled (Docker, VirtualBox, etc.)\nTerminal access with sudo privileges\nInternet connection\nStep-by-Step Installation Guide (Ubuntu/Linux) Step 1: Install kubectl Downlaod the latest stable version: Then make the file executable with: Move it to your system\u0026rsquo;s binary path by: Check the version if it is installed successfully: Step 2: Install minikube Downloa the minikube binary: Install it to your system path: Check version: Step 3: Start the Kubernetes Cluster Recommended: Choose a driver (Docker is common): Optional: this command automatically selects the best available driver on your system (e.g., Docker, VirtualBox, KVM): This downloads the required components and spins up a single-node cluster.\nStep 4: Verify the Cluster is Running Step 5: Interact with Your Cluster You should see one node in a Ready state.\nStep 6: Deploy a Sample App Do you have a deployment? If there’s no output, create one: Option 1: Through kubernetes CLI (kubectl):\nkubectl create deployment hello-node --image=k8s.gcr.io/echoserver:1.4 Option 2: Using the Kubernetes Dashboard (Optional UI):\nLanch the minikube dashboard: If the output says somethin like:\nNo resources found in kubernetes-dashboard namespace. It means the dashboard pods haven’t been created yet - so naturally, proxy health will hang since there\u0026rsquo;s nothing to proxy to.\nHow to Fix it: Manually Enable the Dashboard Addon Minikube is supposed to auto-enable it with minikube dashboard, but sometimes it silently fails. You can force it like this: Then manually install the metrics scraper (recommended for full functionality): Wait and Watch: Then watch pods getting created: Once Running: Launch the dashboard again:\nminikube dashboard Boom! You\u0026rsquo;re in the Kubernetes Dashboard - mission accomplished! This means your entire Minikube cluster is working exactly as it should.\nWhat You Can Do From Here Now that you\u0026rsquo;re inside the dashboard UI, here are a few things worth exploring:\n1. Workloads Check out: Deployments, Pods, ReplicaSets\nTry creating a sample deployment from the UI\n2. Create a Deployment Use the \u0026ldquo;+\u0026rdquo; button (top-right) or go to:\n+ CREATE → Deploy a containerized app I did this simple yaml:\napiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: hello-node spec: replicas: 1 selector: matchLabels: app: hello template: metadata: labels: app: hello spec: containers: - name: hello image: k8s.gcr.io/echoserver:1.10 ports: - containerPort: 8080 3. Expose a Service You can expose your deployment right from the dashboard as a NodePort -then open it in a browser using: This will:\nCreate a Service named hello-node\nExpose port 8080 of your pod\nAssign a random NodePort between 30000–32767\nTo access the app: It should open in your browser! Stopping or Cleaning Up When you\u0026rsquo;re done, you can stop the cluster: minikube stop To delete the cluster entirely: minikube delete Conclusion Kubernetes might seem complex at first, but starting with a local setup helps demystify it. By running a cluster on your own machine using Minikube, you gain the confidence to move to production environments later.\nKubernetes isn’t just a tool - it’s a platform that empowers you to build resilient, scalable, and manageable applications at scale.\n\u0026quot;Learning Kubernetes is like learning how to drive a spaceship.

Jenkins is an open-source automation tool written in Java. It helps developers build, test, and deploy their software automatically, making Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) possible.\nCI: Continuous Integration Automatically building and testing code whenever changes are pushed. CD: Continuous Delivery Automatically deploying/releasing the code to production or staging. Together, CI/CD makes your workflow faster, safer, and hands-free. In simple terms:\nJenkins watches your code and runs jobs (like building or testing) whenever you push changes — saving you tons of manual work.\nJenkins is a server. It’s a program you install on a machine (your own computer, a VPS, or cloud) that:\n• Runs 24/7. • Waits for code changes (like GitHub push). • Does tasks you define (build, test, deploy). • Reports the results. Why Use Jenkins? Automate repetitive tasks like testing and deploying. Supports a wide range of plugins and tools. Saves time in large teams and projects. Detects bugs early by testing code regularly. Web-based interface for managing jobs easily. Key Concepts to Know Term Meaning Job / Project A task that Jenkins runs (e.g., build, test). Build The process of compiling code, running scripts, etc. Pipeline A set of steps that automate the process from build to deployment. Node / Agent A machine that runs Jenkins jobs (can be remote). Plugin Extension that adds new features to Jenkins. How to Install Jenkins on Ubuntu (Beginner-Friendly) Step 1: Install Java Then run: Check the Java version: Step 2: Add Jenkins Repository Step 3: Install Jenkins Step 4: Start and Enable Jenkins Then check the status if its active: Step 5: Open Jenkins in Browser Visit: http://localhost:8080\nTo unlock Jenkins, run:\nPaste the password in your browser when prompted.\nProceed with the steps required and it will get you to the main Jenkins page: Setting Up Your First Job (Freestyle Project) Go to Dashboard \u0026gt; New Item\nChoose Freestyle project and give it a name\nIn Build Steps, choose:\nExecute shell for Linux commands\nOr Execute Windows batch command for Windows\nAdd your script like: echo \u0026#34;Hello from Jenkins!\u0026#34; Click Save, then Build Now Jenkins will run your job and show you output in the Console Output.\nJenkins Pipeline (Scripted Automation) Create a new Pipeline job and use the following example script:\npipeline { agent any stages { stage(\u0026#39;Build\u0026#39;) { steps { echo \u0026#39;Building the project...\u0026#39; } } stage(\u0026#39;Test\u0026#39;) { steps { echo \u0026#39;Running tests...\u0026#39; } } stage(\u0026#39;Deploy\u0026#39;) { steps { echo \u0026#39;Deploying the project...\u0026#39; } } } } Integrating Jenkins with Git (or GitLab) Jenkins works best when connected to a version control system like GitHub or GitLab. This allows Jenkins to:\nWatch for new code pushes Automatically trigger builds and tests Pull code into your pipeline jobs Example (GitLab): Install the Git Plugin (if not already). Create a Personal Access Token in GitLab. In Jenkins, go to Credentials \u0026gt; Add Credentials and enter your GitLab token. Create a new Pipeline or Freestyle job. Under Source Code Management, choose Git and paste your GitLab repo URL. Now every time you push to GitLab, Jenkins can respond automatically.\nUseful Plugins to Explore Plugin Purpose Git Plugin Integrate with Git repositories GitHub Integration Trigger builds from GitHub pushes Pipeline Plugin Use Jenkinsfile for automation workflows Email Extension Send notifications based on build status Docker Plugin Build and run Docker containers via Jenkins Final Thoughts Jenkins is like your project manager robot — it does the boring and repetitive tasks so you can focus on writing code.\nWith its powerful CI/CD pipelines, plugin ecosystem, and integration options, Jenkins is trusted by teams all over the world to ship better software — faster.\nOnce you\u0026rsquo;re comfortable with the basics, explore more advanced topics like:\nShared Libraries (DRY pipelines) Blue Ocean (visual pipeline editor) Dockerized builds Jenkins + Kubernetes or AWS for cloud deployments Jenkins + GitLab CI integration Jenkins is not just a tool, it’s the engine behind modern DevOps.\nJenkins Installation Commands sudo apt update sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk java -version wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io.key | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc \u0026gt; /dev/null echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list \u0026gt; /dev/null sudo apt update sudo apt install jenkins sudo systemctl enable jenkins sudo systemctl start jenkins sudo systemctl status jenkins sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword ","permalink":"http://localhost:41513/posts/jenkins/","summary":"\u003chr\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-is-jenkins\"\u003eWhat is Jenkins?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJenkins\u003c/strong\u003e is an open-source automation tool written in Java.

But behind every site you visit lies a combination of two powerful sides: the frontend and the backend.\nIn this blog, we’ll walk through the core building blocks of each side. This isn’t a tutorial, it’s a clarity-first breakdown of each element so you can understand what it does, and why it\u0026rsquo;s important.\nFrontend: What Users See and Interact With The frontend is the part of a website or web application that users directly experience. It includes everything from layout and buttons to animations and form interactions.\nHTML – The Structure HTML (HyperText Markup Language) forms the basic structure of every web page. It organizes content using tags; like paragraphs, headings, links, and images, so the browser knows what to display and where.\nCSS – The Style CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) adds styling to HTML. It controls how things look—colors, spacing, fonts, responsiveness, and more. Without CSS, all websites would look like plain black-and-white documents.\nBootstrap – Pre-Styled Components Bootstrap is a CSS framework that gives you ready-made design elements like buttons, navbars, and grids. It helps speed up development while ensuring consistency and responsiveness across devices.\nJavaScript – The Interactivity JavaScript brings life to websites. It allows you to respond to user actions—like clicking buttons, filling out forms, or navigating through tabs. It’s what makes websites interactive instead of just static pages.\nDOM Manipulation – Controlling Page Content Dynamically DOM (Document Object Model) manipulation lets you change or update HTML elements using JavaScript in real-time. It\u0026rsquo;s how websites update content on the fly without needing a page reload—like showing a new message or hiding a popup.\nES6 – Modern JavaScript ES6 (ECMAScript 6) introduced newer, cleaner ways to write JavaScript—like arrow functions, let/const, destructuring, and template literals. It improves code readability and helps developers write more efficient scripts.\njQuery – Simplified JavaScript (Legacy Tool) jQuery is a JavaScript library that makes common tasks (like animations, event handling, and AJAX calls) easier with less code. While it’s less used in modern frameworks, it’s still relevant for understanding older projects.\nBackend: What Happens Behind the Scenes The backend powers everything the user doesn’t see—from user authentication and data storage to server-side logic and APIs. It ensures the frontend can access and process information correctly.\nNode.js – JavaScript on the Server Node.js allows JavaScript to run on the server, not just in the browser. It enables backend development using the same language as the frontend and is great for building scalable web applications.\nMongoDB – Flexible Data Storage MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data as JSON-like documents. It’s schema-less and highly flexible, making it ideal for handling unstructured or evolving data.\nExpress.js – Web Framework for Node Express.js is a minimal and powerful web application framework for Node.js. It simplifies routing, request handling, and building RESTful APIs, making backend development faster and more organized.\nSQL – Structured Data Management SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to store and manage data in relational databases. It organizes data in rows and columns and allows precise querying, updating, and filtering of that data.\nPHP – Traditional Server-Side Scripting PHP is a scripting language designed for web development. It’s widely used in websites and content management systems (like WordPress) to handle forms, sessions, and server-side processing.\nPHP REST APIs – Bridging Frontend and Backend REST APIs (in PHP or other languages) act as a bridge between the frontend and backend. They allow applications to send and receive data, enabling communication between the browser and server.\nConclusion: The Full Picture Frontend builds the visual layer—the face users see.\nBackend builds the logic layer—the engine that runs everything under the hood.\nBoth work together to make modern web experiences possible.\nWhether you want to design interfaces or build powerful backend systems (or both!), this roadmap gives you a clear understanding of what each piece does—and why it\u0026rsquo;s important.\nKnowing what each tool does is the first step. Learning how to use it comes next.

But there\u0026rsquo;s one term that often floats around with little explanation, the POSIX shell. What is it, and why does it matter?\nWhat Is a Shell? A shell is a program that provides a command-line interface (CLI) for users to interact with the operating system. There are many types of shells, including:\nbash (Bourne Again Shell) zsh (Z Shell) fish (Friendly Interactive SHell) sh (Bourne Shell) What Is POSIX? POSIX stands for Portable Operating System Interface. It\u0026rsquo;s a set of standards created by the IEEE to make Unix-like operating systems more compatible with each other.\nPOSIX defines a standard shell behavior. This means if you write a script using only POSIX-compliant features, it should work on any POSIX-compliant system, such as:\nLinux macOS BSD systems Many embedded systems What Is the POSIX Shell? The POSIX shell is a standardized shell specification (based on the original Bourne shell) that ensures scripts can run consistently across different Unix-like systems.\nThis doesn\u0026rsquo;t refer to a specific shell executable, but rather a set of rules and features that compliant shells must follow.\nPopular shells like bash, dash, ksh, and zsh all can act as POSIX-compliant when invoked as sh.\nWhy Learn the POSIX Shell? Reason Explanation Portability Your scripts will run on any POSIX-compliant system. Simplicity POSIX scripts are typically cleaner and less complex. Speed Some POSIX shells (like dash) are very fast, making them ideal for boot scripts. Interoperability Ideal for system scripts, Dockerfiles, and CI/CD pipelines. POSIX Shell vs Bash Feature POSIX Shell Bash Compatibility Universal (POSIX systems) Mostly Linux, not POSIX-only Features Minimal Rich, advanced Portability High Moderate Common usage System scripts, init User scripts, interactive use Tip: Stick to POSIX when writing system-level scripts or scripts meant to run anywhere.\nWriting a POSIX Shell Script Let’s start with a simple POSIX-compatible script.\nExample: Hello World #!/bin/sh echo \u0026#34;Hello, POSIX world!\u0026#34; Key POSIX Shell Features 1. Variables name=\u0026#34;Anohba\u0026#34; echo \u0026#34;Hello, $name\u0026#34; No spaces around =, or it will error!\n2. Conditionals if [ \u0026#34;$name\u0026#34; = \u0026#34;Anohba\u0026#34; ]; then echo \u0026#34;Welcome!\u0026#34; fi Use [ ] for conditions, with spaces around the brackets.\n3.

Imagine your program is a big task. Wouldn’t it be more efficient if multiple parts of it could run at the same time instead of waiting for one to finish before the next begins? That’s exactly what multithreading allows.\nMultithreading is a technique where a single process can perform multiple tasks concurrently using threads. Think of threads as lightweight mini-programs that live inside a main program, sharing the same memory and resources.\nWhy Use Multithreading? Faster Performance: Multiple tasks run in parallel, reducing total execution time. Smarter Resource Use: Threads share the same memory space, avoiding the overhead of separate processes. Better Responsiveness: Your app’s UI remains responsive even when doing heavy background work. Threading vs Multiprocessing? Feature Multithreading Multiprocessing Memory Usage Low (shared memory) High (separate memory) Suitable for I/O-bound tasks CPU-bound tasks GIL Affected Not affected Complexity Simple Slightly complex How Does It All Work? Each thread has:\nIts own program counter (tells it what to do next) Its own stack (for storing variables and function calls) Access to the shared heap memory (common data area) The system’s thread scheduler decides how and when threads run, sometimes switching between them rapidly, this is called context switching.\nWhere Do We Use Multithreading? Games: Audio, rendering, physics, all handled by separate threads. Web servers: Manage thousands of user requests at once. Image editors: Apply filters to different image parts in parallel. Downloaders: Download file segments simultaneously. Writing Threads in Different Languages Python import threading def task(): print(\u0026#34;Running in thread\u0026#34;) thread = threading.Thread(target=task) thread.start() What’s Happening Here? threading.Thread() creates a thread object.\n.start() begins execution in a new thread.\n.join() tells the main program to wait until the thread is done.\nBest Practices Keep threads short-lived and task-specific Use .join() to avoid premature exits Avoid sharing mutable data unless protected Consider threading.Lock() when using shared resources What Makes Multithreading Hard? Multithreading brings speed, but also complexity:\nRace Conditions: Threads compete to access shared data, leading to unpredictable results. Deadlocks: Two threads wait on each other forever. Starvation: One thread never gets a turn. Hard to Debug: Bugs can appear only in specific timings or conditions. Tips for Writing Thread-Safe Code Use mutexes/locks to protect shared resources.\nPrefer immutable objects where possible.\nMinimize shared state.\nUse thread-safe libraries or higher-level concurrency tools like:\nconcurrent.futures (Python)\nExecutorService (Java)\nstd::async (C++) NOTE: I haven\u0026rsquo;t Explored this part though these are the possible solutions I found on Google.\nSummary Multithreading in Python is a powerful tool, especially when working with I/O-bound operations. While the GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) limits its use for CPU-intensive work, multithreading is still a go-to choice for network calls, UI responsiveness, and parallel I/O.\n“Concurrency is not parallelism, but it’s a good place to start.” – Rob Pike\n","permalink":"http://localhost:41513/posts/multithread/","summary":"\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u0026ldquo;Threads are like tiny workers inside your program — when they cooperate well, your application becomes faster, smoother, and more responsive.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-is-multithreading\"\u003eWhat is Multithreading?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImagine your program is a big task.

The answer lies in Huffman Coding — a beautifully simple yet powerful algorithm used for lossless data compression. It\u0026rsquo;s been a cornerstone since it was introduced.\nWhat Is Huffman Coding? Huffman Coding is a greedy algorithm used to compress data without losing any information. The idea is simple:\nAssign shorter codes to more frequent characters and longer codes to less frequent ones. Ever tried zipping a file to save space? That magic trick behind the scenes? That’s compression — and Huffman Coding is one of the smartest ways to pull it off.\nIt’s like using nicknames. Instead of saying \u0026ldquo;Jonathanathan\u0026rdquo; every time, you just say \u0026ldquo;Jon\u0026rdquo;. Saves time. Saves space. No information lost. That\u0026rsquo;s the Huffman vibe.\nIt uses a binary tree structure to build optimal prefix codes (no code is a prefix of another), ensuring efficient encoding and decoding.\nTerminologies Term What It Means Character Frequency How many times a character appers in the text. Leaf Node A tree piece that holds a character. It has no children. Internal Node A tree piece that connects other nodes. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t hold a character. Root Node The top part of the tree that connects everything. Min Heap A list that always gives the smallest number first. Binary Code Assignment Left turn = 0, right turn = 1. Used to make codes from the tree. Prefix-Free Code No code starts the same as another, so there\u0026rsquo;s no confusion when reading. Compression Making data smaller so it takes up less space. How It Works (Step-by-Step) Calculate Frequencies\nCount how many times each character appears in the input data.\nBuild a Priority Queue\nEach character becomes a leaf node with its frequency as weight.\nBuild the Huffman Tree\nRepeatedly:\nTake two lowest-frequency nodes, Combine them into a new node with the sum of their frequencies, Insert the new node back into the queue. Continue until only one node (the root) is left. Assign Binary Codes\nTraverse the tree:\nGo left ➡️ append 0 Go right ➡️ append 1 Example Let’s take a simple string:\n\u0026#34;beep boop beer\u0026#34; We’ll walk through how Huffman compresses this.\nStep 1: Frequency Count We start by counting the frequency of each character in the string \u0026ldquo;beep boop beer\u0026rdquo;:\nb: 3 e: 4 o: 2 p: 2 r: 1 (space): 2 These frequencies help us decide which characters should get short or long codes.\nStep 2: Build a Min Heap Next, we create a Min Heap (priority queue) from the characters and their frequencies:\n[ r:1, o:2, p:2, (space):2, b:3, e:4 ]\nWe repeatedly take out the two lowest frequency nodes, combine them, and put the result back into the heap. This process eventually forms our Huffman Tree.\nStep 3: Create the Huffman Tree Keep merging the two smallest nodes until only one node (the root) remains. Let’s say we get this structure:\nStep 4: Assign Binary Codes Now, we traverse the tree and assign binary codes. The rule is:\nLeft = 0 Right = 1 From the tree, we get the following codes:\ne → 10 b → 11 (space) → 000 p → 001 r → 1000 o → 1001 (Note: The exact codes may vary depending on how the tree was built, but they will always be prefix-free.)\nStep 5: Encode the Original String Let’s encode the original string \u0026ldquo;beep boop beer\u0026rdquo; using the Huffman codes:\nOriginal:\nb e e p b o o p b e e r\nUsing the codes:\nb → 11 e → 10 p → 001 (space) → 000 o → 1001 r → 1000\nSo, we get the following binary string: 11 10 10 001 11 1001 1001 001 11 10 10 1000\nFinal Binary String: 111010001111001100100010010110101000\nThis is much smaller than using 8-bit ASCII per character.\nWhere Is Huffman Coding Used? Huffman coding is used extensively in:\nFile Compression: Formats like .zip, .gz Image Compression: JPEG (in entropy encoding stage) Video Compression: MPEG, H.264 codecs Text Compression: Unix compress, PDF text compression Data transmission: When minimizing bandwidth is critical Advantages Lossless Compression — No data is lost during encoding.\nOptimal for symbol-by-symbol encoding — Based on frequency.\nFast and Simple — Efficient in both compression and decompression.\nPrefix-free codes — No ambiguity during decoding.\nDisadvantages Requires Frequency Table — Needs to be stored/sent along with compressed data.\nNot Always Best — For small data sets or near-uniform frequencies, it might not compress well.\nStatic — Doesn’t adapt to changing data unless used in a dynamic/adaptive version.\nTree Overhead — Storing the tree adds some overhead for very small inputs.\nWhen Not to Use Huffman Coding If you\u0026rsquo;re compressing already compressed files (like .mp4, .png) When your data has very little redundancy If you\u0026rsquo;re aiming for real-time compression with fast, adaptive techniques (like Arithmetic or LZ-based compression) Conclusion Huffman Coding remains one of the most elegant examples of how theory meets practicality. It teaches us the value of frequency, greedy algorithms, and efficient data structures — all wrapped in a sweet little binary tree.\nWhether you’re building your own compression tool, diving into how JPEG works, or just brushing up for a comp-sci interview, Huffman Coding is a must-know classic.\n“The art of programming is the art of organizing complexity.” — Edsger Dijkstra\n","permalink":"http://localhost:41513/posts/huffman/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn a world drowning in data, how do we store and transmit information more efficiently?

It is widely used in network routing, mapping applications, and many areas of computer science.\nWhat Is Dijkstra’s Algorithm? Dijkstra’s Algorithm solves the single-source shortest path problem in a graph with non-negative edge weights. It finds the shortest path from a starting node (source) to every other node in the graph.\nKey Characteristics Graph Type: Works on both directed and undirected graphs. Directed Graph (Digraph) A directed graph has edges with a direction — like a one-way street. Each edge goes from one node to another specific node. Example: If there’s an edge from A to B, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean you can go from B to A unless there\u0026rsquo;s a separate edge for that.\n🡒 Notation: A → B Undirected Graph An undirected graph has edges without direction — like a two-way street. If there\u0026rsquo;s an edge between two nodes, you can move in both directions.\nExample: If there\u0026rsquo;s an edge between A and B, you can go from A to B and also from B to A.\n🡒 Notation: A — B\nEdge Weights: Requires all edge weights to be non-negative.\nOptimality: Guarantees the shortest path from the source to every other node.\nGreedy Approach: Selects the node with the smallest known distance at each step.\nTerminologies Node/Vertex: A point in the graph. Edge: A connection between two nodes. Weight: The cost to travel between two connected nodes. Visited Set: Nodes whose shortest distance from the source is finalized. Distance Map: Stores the currently known shortest distance from the source to each node. How the Algorithm Works Initialization Set the distance to the source node as 0. Set the distance to all other nodes as ∞ (infinity). Keep all nodes as unvisited. Create a priority queue or min-heap to fetch the node with the smallest distance. Priority Queue: A priority queue is like a line where each item has a number (priority), and the item with the smallest number gets picked first — not just the one who came first. In Dijkstra’s Algorithm, it helps quickly find the next closest node to visit.\nMain Loop Pick the unvisited node with the smallest known distance. For each of its neighbors: Calculate the new distance using:\nnew_distance = current_distance + edge_weight If new_distance is less than the known distance, update it. Mark the current node as visited. Repeat until all nodes are visited or the shortest path is found. Example Given the following weighted graph:\nA ---3--- B | | 1 2 | | C ---4--- D Starting from A:\nInitial distances: A = 0, B = ∞, C = ∞, D = ∞ Visit A: Update B = 3, C = 1 Visit C: Update D = 1 + 4 = 5 Visit B: Update D = min(5, 3 + 2) = 5 (no change) Final distances: A = 0, B = 3, C = 1, D = 5 Why Dijkstra Does Not Support Negative Weights Dijkstra’s Algorithm assumes that once the shortest path to a node is found, it will not change. This assumption fails with negative weights, where a shorter path might appear later. Therefore, the algorithm does not work correctly with negative-weight edges.\nComparison with Other Algorithms Algorithm Handles Negative Weights Use Case Dijkstra No Fastest for non-negative weights Bellman-Ford Yes Used when graph may contain negative weights Floyd-Warshall Yes Computes all-pairs shortest paths A* Search (typically) Best for pathfinding with a known goal Applications GPS and Navigation systems Network routing protocols (e.g., OSPF) Robot and AI pathfinding Traffic simulation Flight scheduling systems Summary Dijkstra’s Algorithm is used to find the shortest paths from a single source node to all other nodes. It works only with non-negative edge weights. The algorithm uses a greedy approach and a priority queue for efficiency. It’s fast, reliable, and widely used in real-world applications.

It helps you test your code easily.\nFor example:\nYou write a function: def — Define a Function def is short for define. It\u0026rsquo;s used to create a function in Python. assert — Check if Something is True assert is used to check if a condition is true. If it is true, Python does nothing and continues. If it’s false, Python throws an AssertionError. This code is checking:\nDoes add(2, 3) give 5? Does add(0, 0) give 0? And so on. Testing with pytest Put this in a file called test_add.py, then run this in your terminal:\nIf all is good, you’ll see a green message.\nIf something is wrong, pytest will show you what failed.\nWhy Use pytest? It’s simple to use The code is easy to read You get clear messages when something fails Final Thoughts Testing might feel boring at first.\nBut it saves you time and trouble later.\nStart small — test just one function.\nIt’s a good habit to build.\nYour code will thank you.\nAnd so will your future self.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:41513/posts/test/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"why-testing-your-code-matters\"\u003eWhy Testing Your Code Matters\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we write code, we want it to work.

Here’s how you can set it up and use it on Ubuntu:\n1. Prepare Ubuntu The first thing you need to do before you start installing SSH on Ubuntu is to update all apt packages to the latest versions. To do this, use the following command:\nsudo apt update \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sudo apt upgrade 2. Install SSH on Ubuntu First, ensure SSH is installed on both the client (your local machine) and the server (remote machine).\nOn the server (remote machine), install the SSH server: Note: For this type of connection, both the client (local system) and the server (remote system) should be on the same network.\nTo check if SSH is running: If it’s not running, start it with:\nsudo systemctl start ssh 2. Allow SSH Through the Firewall If you have a firewall enabled, allow SSH connections: Then, enable the firewall if it\u0026rsquo;s not already active: 3. Find the Server’s IP Address To connect to your server, you need its IP address. Run:\nip a IP is usually something like 192.168.x.x.\n4. Connect to the Server via SSH On your client machine, use this command to connect:\nNote: As it is a connection with remote system, you need to add the user name and IP-address of system with which you are building connection.\nEnter the password when prompted ( remember it is the password connection. For this type of SSH you need to know to password of remote system)\u0026gt;\nYou have now successfully built a connection with remote system through password!\nSet Up Passwordless SSH (Optional But Recommended) If you don’t want to enter a password every time, set up SSH key authentication:\n🔹 Generate an SSH Key (Skip if you already have one) On your local machine, run:\nssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C \u0026#34;SSHkey\u0026#34; Press Enter for all options.\n🔹 Copy the SSH Key to the New Remote System ssh-copy-id username@remote_IP Enter the password once. After this, SSH should work without a password!\nLoopback SSH If you want to connect to your own system using SSH (also called loopback SSH or local SSH connection), follow these steps:\nSteps: Install SSH on Ubuntu\nAllow SSH Through the Firewall\nFind the Server’s IP Address Note: In this case, you need the IP-address of your own system.\nConnect to the Server via SSH\nEnter the password when prompted.\nDisconnect from SSH To exit the SSH session, type:\nexit You’ve successfully connected to your own system via SSH!\nConclusion SSH isn’t just a tool—it’s your secret tunnel into remote (or even your own) system!

It is an essential aspect of software development that helps in debugging, monitoring, and maintaining applications.\nPython provides a built-in logging module that makes it easy to track events and errors in your code\nWhy Use Logging? Many beginners use print() statements for debugging, logging provides a better way to record messages, debug issues, and monitor applications.\nSeverity Levels: Logging allows categorization of messages by severity (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL).\nConfigurability: You can easily change logging levels, formats, and destinations without modifying the code.\nPerformance: Logging can be written to files, reducing console clutter and making debugging easier.\nAdvantages: Logging is useful for:\nDebugging: Helps identify and fix issues in your code.\nMonitoring: Tracks application behavior over time.\nError Handling: Provides useful error messages and tracebacks.\nPerformance Analysis: Measures execution time and performance bottlenecks.\nStorage: Saves logs for future analysis.\nGetting Started with Logging Basic Example: Python’s logging module provides a simple way to log messages. For example:\nimport logging # configuring logging logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG) # log messages logging.info(\u0026#34;This is a debug message.\u0026#34;) logging.info(\u0026#34;This is an informational message\u0026#34;) logging.warning(\u0026#34;This is a warning message\u0026#34;) logging.error(\u0026#34;This is an error message\u0026#34;) logging.critical(\u0026#34;This is a critical message\u0026#34;) Understanding Log Levels The logging module provides five different levels of severity:\nLevel Numeric Value Description DEBUG 10 Detailed information, useful for debugging INFO 20 General information about program execution WARNING 30 Indication of potential issues ERROR 40 A serious problem occurred CRITICAL 50 A critical error that may cause a system crash By default, Python’s logging module displays messages of level WARNING and above.\nConfiguring Logging You can customize logging using basicConfig(). For example:\nlogging.basicConfig( level=logging.DEBUG, format=\u0026#39;%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s\u0026#39;, datefmt=\u0026#39;%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\u0026#39; ) Logging to a File Instead of printing logs to the console, you can save them to a file:\nlogging.basicConfig( filename=\u0026#39;app.log\u0026#39;, level=logging.DEBUG, format=\u0026#39;%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s\u0026#39;, datefmt=\u0026#39;%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\u0026#39; ) Formatting Logs You can customize the log message format using format:\nlogging.basicConfig( format=\u0026#39;%(levelname)s: %(message)s\u0026#39; ) logging.warning(\u0026#34;This is a formatted warning message.\u0026#34;) Common format specifiers: %(asctime)s - Timestamp of the log message %(levelname)s - Log level (INFO, WARNING, etc.) %(message)s - The actual log message %(filename)s - Name of the source file %(lineno)d - Line number where the log was generated Advanced Logging Features For more control over logs, the logging module allows creating separate loggers handlers, and formattersfor different modules\nBest Practices for Logging Use appropriate log levels: Don\u0026rsquo;t log everything as DEBUG or INFO. Avoid logging sensitive data: Logs may be stored and accessed by others. Use structured logging: Format logs in a way that makes them easy to analyze. Rotate log files: Prevent logs from growing too large using RotatingFileHandler. Use separate log files for different purposes: Keep error logs separate from general logs. Conclusion Logging in Python is a powerful tool that helps track, debug, and analyze code execution. By understanding logging levels, configurations, and best practices, you can improve debugging, monitoring, and error handling in your applications.\nStart implementing logging in your projects today and make your debugging process smoother! 🚀\n","permalink":"http://localhost:41513/posts/pythonlog/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLogging is a means of tracking events that happen when some software runs.

It’s not a type of rubber, but rather the holy grail of document creation for nerds, academics, and anyone tired of Word’s unpredictable formatting tantrums. If you’ve ever wondered how professors produce those intimidatingly perfect papers, here’s the secret: LaTeX.\nBut beware: LaTeX is a bit like taming a dragon. Powerful, majestic, and occasionally a total nightmare. Let’s explore this magical tool together—complete with humor, tips, and (imagined) visuals to keep you smiling through the frustration.\nWhat Is LaTeX? Imagine a world where your essays look like professional publications, your equations flow seamlessly, and your references magically align themselves. That’s LaTeX!\nInstead of clicking buttons, you code your documents. Yes, it’s intimidating at first. But once you conquer the learning curve, you’ll never go back. Plus, saying “I use LaTeX” sounds so much cooler than “I formatted this in Word.”\nVisual Idea: A split-screen image of a messy Word doc on one side vs. a flawless LaTeX-rendered thesis on the other, captioned: “You vs. the document she told you not to worry about.”\nWhy Use LaTeX? Equations Done Right: LaTeX makes math look beautiful, like this classic: E = mc^2 (Word users are still trying to find the superscript button.) No Formatting Nightmares: In LaTeX, what you code is what you get. (Well, after a few tries and possibly some tears.) Flexibility for Everything: Resumes, books, presentations—LaTeX can handle it all. It’s like the Swiss Army knife of document creation. Visual Idea: An infographic of \u0026ldquo;What LaTeX Can Do\u0026rdquo; with icons for \u0026ldquo;Math,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Theses,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Resumes,\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Books.\u0026rdquo;\nStep 1: Getting Started Without Crying Option A: The Easy Way (Overleaf) For the uninitiated, Overleaf is your best friend. It’s an online LaTeX editor that lets you skip the installation drama and dive straight into coding your masterpiece.\nOption B: The Hardcore Way (Local Installation) Download TeX Live (Windows/Linux) or MacTeX (macOS). Warning: This path includes manually setting up your editor and possibly shouting at your computer. Recommended only if you enjoy challenges.\nStep 2: Your First LaTeX Document Let’s start with the LaTeX equivalent of “Hello, World!”:\n\\documentclass{article} \\begin{document} Hello, World! This is my first LaTeX document. \\end{document} Compile this code, and BOOM! You’ve created a document that does absolutely nothing but look fancy. If it didn’t compile, double-check for typos or pray to the LaTeX gods.\nThe Good, The Bad, and The Hilarious The Good: Why You’ll Fall in Love with LaTeX Equations That Slap Tired of clunky math formatting in Word? LaTeX delivers flawless results every time.\nHere’s an example:\n\\begin{equation} E = mc^2 \\end{equation} This produces:\nE=mc^2\nLooks like something straight out of Einstein’s notebook, right?\nBibliographies, Solved Forget manually formatting your references. Just create a .bib file and let BibTeX do the hard work.\n\\bibliography{references} \\bibliographystyle{plain} Compile twice, and voilà—your citations are perfect. (Miss a step, and chaos will reign.)\nThe Bad: Tables (or, The True Test of Patience) Ah, tables—the nemesis of many LaTeX users. They look beautiful when done, but writing them feels like solving a Rubik’s Cube blindfolded.\nExample:\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \\hline Column 1 \u0026amp; Column 2 \\\\ \\hline Data 1 \u0026amp; Data 2 \\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular} Rendered output?\nColumn 1\tColumn 2 Data 1\tData 2 Gorgeous. Writing it? Exhausting. Remember to add lines (\\hline) or the table police will come for you.\nThe Hilarious: Errors That Make You Question Life When Things Go Wrong (And They Will)\nLaTeX errors are a special kind of pain:\n\u0026ldquo;Missing } inserted\u0026rdquo;: Somewhere, you forgot a curly brace.
