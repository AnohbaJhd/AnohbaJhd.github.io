## LINUX

 Linux is a best-known, versatile and most used open-source operating system initially developed by Linus Torvalds in 1991 as a 'hobby'. There are many distributions or distros (different organizations and communities create their own versions e.g Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora etc.) of Linux, which include different software options. This means that Linux is incredibly customizable.

## Ubuntu

 Ubuntu was used after the African philosopher translated it to “Humanity to Other”. Ubuntu has been derived from Debian’s architecture and the Linux server.
